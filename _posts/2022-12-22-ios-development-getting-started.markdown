## Foreword:

This is a brief article showing some of the minimum requirements you should preapre to become an iOS Developer.

### Mac Computer

<div class="side-by-side">
    <div class="toleft">
        <p>Firstly, you must have the <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/" target="_blank">Mac computer</a>. You have to buy a Macbook Pro or any kind of macOS computer family like Mac Mini, Mac Pro, Macbook Air.</p>
        <p>I strongly recommend the computer should be at least 16GB of RAM and running the latest macOS version.</p>

        <figcaption class="caption">iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch</figcaption>
    </div>

    <div class="toright">
        <p>This is a recommendation, you should have the physical iOS devices like <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhones</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad/" target="_blank">iPads</a>, or <a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/" target="_blank">Apple Watch</a> if you are going to develop Watch Apps.</p>
        <p>It's sound like a lot when you are get started the journey but it will be worth it.</p>

### Apple Develop Account

<div class="side-by-side">
    <div class="toleft">
        <p>If you haven't enroll the Apple Developer Program yet, start now from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/" target="_blank">Apple Developer Program</a> and resgister one.</p>
        <p>Basically, you could use a free account. But in order to submit your apps to the App Store, you must enroll the paid account which is $99/year.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="toright">
        <p>Install <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/" target="_blank">Xcode</a> from the Mac App Store, that's the IDE that you will use to develop Apple native applications including iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS applications.</p>

    <div class="toleft">
        <p><a href="https://swift.org" target="_blank">Swift</a> is a modern language, support new programming features, and has 4X faster build time than Objective-C.</p>
        <p>Swift was designed to be a simple and understandable language. So, why don't use Swift?</p>

    <div class="toleft">
        <p>Ensure your app was fully tested before submitting to the App Store.</p>
        <p>Check out the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/submit/" target="_blank">submit required</a> from Apple and follow the guidelines. Your app will be ready for reviewing and publishing.</p>
